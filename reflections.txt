How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    well interface is confusing but shows lines that were removed and added
	could find spelling mistake.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Can find code used for function but removed again in future
	Attribution and blame shifting, also know who to contact that last worked
	on a feature.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    auto is good for history so if you forget to commit you have something
	to fall back on, however saving code is better after a logical step is complete
		and having a working unit to fall back on.
